        <h2>Hello! My name is Mike Mann and you have reached my portfolio.</h2>
        <p>I am a highly skilled software engineer with extensive experience in embedded systems development,
        network communication, and industrial protocol implementation. I have a proven ability to architect,
        develop, and maintain complex software solutions, including EtherNet/IP protocol stacks and
        automated vehicle GUI interfaces. Expertise in C/C++, C#, and a range of embedded platforms
        (Windows, Linux, VxWorks) with a strong track record of mentoring teams, driving protocol
        standards, and contributing to open-source projects like Wireshark (1900+ commits).</p>

            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <h3>JBT</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column left">

                </div>
                <div class="column right">
                    <p>At JBT I was part of the <a href="https://www.jbtc.com/automated-systems/">Automated Systems</a> group that made Automated
                    Guided Vehicles (AGVs).  My 6+ years at JBT were spent on the vehicle software side. With my many years of C++ and embedded experience
                    I quickly became the lead developer and "unofficial architect".  I spent a lot of time refactoring code to make it more object-oriented and
                    creating libraries for modularity and reuse.  I added more and better ways to diagnose problems with the AGVs in the field to make the 
                    field engineers' job easier. All with the goal of reducing a large amount of accumulated technical debt.</p>
                    <p>I also wrote several internal tools for diagnostics and easier application development.  These were both full C# applications using
                    WPF/MVVM as well as command line tools</p>
                    <p>The vehicle software team was already using git when I arrived, but I was able to share my knowledge of "best practices" and also
                    help other departments in adopting git</p>

            <h3>Pyramid Solutions</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column right">
                    <p>In my 17 years at Pyramid Solutions I was involved in many projects. I was part of the Data Communications department that focused on helping
                    clients with software applications that involved network connectivity (PC applications, embedded devices, TCP/IP, Serial, etc). This exposed me to
                    a lot of different development environments and IDEs.  And because of this, I'm comfortable finding my way through any build environment or working
                    with any IDE, even if I haven't used it before.  I've also used several different source control schemes (although I prefer git).</p>
                    <p>The bulk of my involvement at Pyramid Solutions centered around the industrial protocol EtherNet/IP.
                    I was responsible for Pyramid Solution's EtherNet/IP's protocol stack.  It was sold as a standalone product, but I would also frequently do the 
                    integration into clients' embedded devices.  This is where I learned what "code portability" really means and that not all TCP/IP stacks 
                    are created equal, i.e. BSD compatible.</p>
                    <p>I also put a lot of time towards ODVA, the standards organization that owns and promotes the EtherNet/IP protocol (CIP over Ethernet).  I was involved
                    with the conformance and interoperability of EtherNet/IP devices, meeting with EtherNet/IP device vendors to ensure compatibility between all devices.  I
                    was also instrumental in defining the specification for CIP-Modbus, a network translation layer when going from CIP to Modbus devices.</p>

            <h2>Passion Projects</h2>
            <p>Most of my professional code development is not available for public consumption.
            However, here are some projects I've worked on independently.</p>
            <h3>Python + AI</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column left">
                    <img class="column-img" src="gemini_python.png" alt="Python and Gemini logos">
                </div>
                <div class="column right">
                    <p>I was interested in learning Python and also about how AI is helping to write code. So I took the
                    Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code">100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</a>
                    with a twist.  While I did the exercises myself, I also tried to prompt Google's Gemini to generate
                    code that would also complete the exercises. Overall, Gemini did fairly well, but it wasn't always
                    a clean copy/paste or Gemini provided different working solutions than expected by the exercise.</p>
                    <p>The repository of the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/mmann78/100DaysOfCode">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Wireshark</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column right">
                <p>I was introduced to Wireshark during my time at Pyramid Solutions. At the time I was working on additional
                features to the EtherNet/IP protocol and the Wireshark dissection for it was incomplete. After getting over
                the hump of setting up the development environment (well documented, but lots of steps), I submitted my first
                patch.  After a few rounds of review, the patch was accepted.  I realized that EtherNet/IP is a "complicated"
                protocol from a dissection standpoint (involves both TCP and UDP and several dissection layers) and the best way
                to learn the Wireshark API to continue to improve the EtherNet/IP dissector was to try to understand
                and improve other protocols from existing bug reports. I eventually earned a spot as a core developer,
                with a lot of focus on refactoring the dissection engine for the transition to the Qt GUI interface
                and code reviewing submitted patches and trying to get them integrated into the main branch. I also attended
                a few Sharkfests (Wireshark developer/user conference)</p>
                <p>Most of my work has already been submitted to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark">main branch</a> (over 1900 commits!),
                but I keep a <a href="https://gitlab.com/mmann78/wireshark">forked repository</a> as that's how new
                functionality is currently added.</p>

            <h3>Carcassonne</h3>

                <div class="column right">
                <p></p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)">Carcassonne</a> is my favorite
                "board" game. You place tiles and meeples to construct castles, roads and farms to earn points.
                During the pandemic, I discovered the (abandoned) source to play Carcassonne on <a href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/">Tabletop Simulator</a>.
                It's written in Lua, which I was unfamiliar with, but I lept at the chance to work on it.  My two
                major areas of focus were refactoring the code to more easily separate and identify the different
                expansion rules and adding final game statistics to provide analytics to game play.  Was also able
                to have friends and family test my changes in our weekly online game.</p>
